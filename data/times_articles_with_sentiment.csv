Times,Tax measures under scrutiny,https://times.mw/tax-measures-under-scrutiny/,economy,"Debate has ensued among commentators and economists over the revenue collection enforcement drive by the Malawi Revenue Authority (MRA) on some taxes andnew tax measures recently introducedby the government.
Experts say while the measures are necessary for addressing fiscal pressure, they could hurt businesses and other tax payers, if enforced haphazardly.
For instance, in recent weeks, MRA called on property owners to register, obtain Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TPINs) and declare rental income ahead of a nationwide landlord identification exercise scheduled this February, as it moves to enforce tax collection on rentals.
But analysts warn that while broadening the tax base is crucial for fiscal stability, its success would hinge on public trust, gradual implementation and visible improvements in service delivery by duty bearers.
The revenue collection body also postponed rollout of its Electronic Invoicing System (EIS) to May this year following protests over inadequate consultation and low civic education.
In an interview on Tuesday, economist Marvin Banda said tax reforms are central to stabilising public finances and reducing Malawi’s dependence on borrowing and donor funding.
Banda said compliance would allow the government to improve public services while shrinking chronic fiscal shortfalls.
Malawi’s budget deficits have averaged 10 to 14 percent of GDP, and according to Banda, without increased revenue mobilisation, the country risks deepening debt burdens and aid dependency.
“By broadening the tax base and improving tax compliance the government would be able to improve the type and quality of public service delivery, reduce fiscal deficits, debt financing and aid dependency,” he said.
However, Banda acknowledged widespread public frustration with the tax system due to poor public service delivery.
He said gradual taxation is ideal for Malawi’s situation to allow the taxpayers adapt to the changing environment.
Taxation expert Emmanual Kaluluma said rental income tax laws, for instance, have existed for years, with the real problems lying in weak compliance, limited taxpayer education and uneven enforcement.
Kaluluma cautioned against what he described as a blanket application of the law without regard to Malawi’s poverty levels and income distribution.
Speaking on Times Radio on Monday, MRA Manager for Domestic Taxes– Technical Enock Hapala said landlords will only be taxed on profits after expenses, with the first K2.04 million charged at zero percent and income above that threshold taxed at 30 percent.
MRA Head of Corporate Affairs Wilma Chalulu said the implementation would be phased.
Other tax measures introduced in the 2025-26 Budget include removal of the 25 percent tax band on Pay As You Earn, with incomes between K170 000 and K1.57 million now attracting 30 percent tax. Those up to K10 million will be taxed at 35 percent while a new 40 percent tax rate applies beyond that threshold.
When presenting the mid-year budget statement, Minister of Finance Joseph Mwanamvekha announced the increase in the value added tax (VAT) rate from 16.5 percent to 17.5 percent.
He also announced the introduction of a 0.05 percent bank transfer levy to be applied on all bank transfers and another 0.05 percent mobile money levy on mobile money transfers of above K100 000 to be paid by the sender.
In its 2025 Annual Economic Report, Malawi Confederation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry said while necessary for addressing Malawi’s fiscal pressures, the revenue measures, have important implications for the business environment.
The chambers called for a carefully balanced policy approach. The government faces fiscal pressure amid low revenue generation and rising public debt, now at K24.2 trillion, a situation which makes revenue mobilisation an increasingly urgent policy priority.",-0.020367437440608167,0.4078634779854291,neutral
Times,US flags corruption as  major business hurdle,https://times.mw/us-flags-corruption-as-major-business-hurdle/,economy,"The United States (US) State Department has saidcorruption remains a major obstacleto doing business in Malawi.
In its 2025 Investment Climate Statement for Malawi, the US State Department notes that although some progress has been made to curb the vice, firms with US affiliations have reported irregularities in tender processes and mining licensing.
The US State Department says despite these challenges, the companies have continued to pursue business opportunities in the country.
The Investment Climate Statement says corruption, fraud, bribery of public officials, illicit payments, misuse of funds and conflicts of interest are reportedly common in Malawi.
It adds that several high-profile government scandals have occurred under all recent presidential administrations.
According to the report, although corruption in all its forms is illegal in Malawi, enforcement remains insufficient and slow.
The 2025 Investment Climate Statement further says Malawian law requires all public officials at all levels of government to declare their assets and business interests.
“However, access to view or obtain copies of the declarations is difficult at best and the law does not extend to family members,” it says.
The US State Department adds that although all public officials are required to disclose any conflict of interest and to recuse themselves from any deliberation or decision-making process related to such conflicts, there is no clear definition of what constitutes a conflict of interest.
“In practice, the requirements for public asset declarations, political party financial reporting, and conflict of interest disclosures are rarely enforced, and noncompliance is high,” it says.
ACB acting Director General Gabriel Chembezi asked for more time before commenting on the matter.
In its 2025 Annual Economic and Business Review, the Malawi Confederation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (MCCCI) says foreign exchange scarcity emerged as the most significant business challenge in 2025, with 74.1 percent of respondents ranking it among their top three constraints.
The review says inflation was cited as the second most critical challenge, at 70.4 percent, followed by rising input costs at 55.6 percent, policy uncertainty at 29.6 percent, and high interest rates at 22.2 percent.
According to the MCCCI, only 3.7 percent of respondents reported not being affected by foreign exchange shortages, while 63.0 percent said they were severely and frequently impacted, highlighting the widespread and persistent nature of the challenge.",0.07164285714285713,0.38585714285714284,neutral

Local football analysts have since questioned the development, arguing that associations might be crippled by electing incapable candidates.
The development comes after some quarters accused Fam leadership of handpicking candidates to contest.
Newly established Eastern Region Football Association (ERFA) will hold its elective annual general assembly in Mangochi today with most candidates set to be elected unopposed.
The only battle would be between interim general secretary Francis Onions facing new blood Harold Kachepatsonga.
However, Abdul Chiwalo (Chairperson), Ella Nyirongo (vice General Secretary), Peterkins Nkondwazi (Treasurer) and Brenda Chunga (vice Treasurer) would be elected unopposed.
Similarly, the Southern Region Football Association (SRFA) would hold its polls next week and most aspirants are set to go unopposed.
SRFA’ Vice Chairperson Dyles Kachala is set to replace Chairperson Raphael Humba unopposed while Patrick Mbalati will go for the post of Vice Chairperson unopposed.
Pharaoh Phiri has been nominated for the post of Treasurer unopposed.
Local football analysts feel the situation is unhealthy for the sport.
Interestingly, Northern Region Football Association (NRFA) and Central Region Football Association (CRFA) have aspirants vying for various positions.
It is a similar case at NRFA where candidates have emerged challenging each other.
Football pundit Roy Abramo M’dechi has described the situation as worrisome.
“There are two things here. It could be that people did not show interest to contest or upon realising possible candidates some bow out of the race, fearing they might lose.
“As for the central and northern regions it is different, having attracted interest from a lot of candidates. Perhaps in these regions candidates feel they can add value in these regions,” M’dechi said.
Similarly, Blantyre District Football League Chairperson Mario Gadaga lamented lack of interest to contest in the elections.
“People did not express interest for whatever reasons but it is very unfortunate for the game as you need aspirants to outline manifestos to outdo each other,” Gadaga said.
Meanwhile, CRFA incumbent Chairperson Austin Ajawa will face Goodall Chinjoka whereas Abel Chiumia and Gift Jere would battle for the post of Vice Chairperson.
The post of General Secretary would see Antonio Manda and Christopher Njeula battling whereas Walesi Kazonde and Williams Kapenuka are set to tussle for the post of Vice General Secretary.
Hastings Chilunga and Charles Majidu are contesting for the Treasurers post.
Incumbent General Secretary Masiya Nyasulu faces Chauka Mwasinga for the post of the Chairperson. The post of Vice Chairperson would attract Ralph Kasilika and Ephimack Lwanja.

Times,27 million litres DRC fuel mystery,https://times.mw/27-million-litres-drc-fuel-mystery/,politics,"By Mercy Matonga
Mystery surrounds what happened to some 27 million litres of fuel the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) donated to Malawi in 2023, as authorities struggle to account for the bulk of the fuel.
Malawi Newscan report that out of the 27 million liters announced by the DRC government to have been donated in August 2023 when former president Lazarus Chakwera visited Angola, where he met the President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Félix Tshisekedi Tshilombo, only 2.3 million liters arrived in the country.
During the meeting, Tshisekedi pledged the nearly 30 million litres of fuel to Malawi, following the fuel shortages that the country had been facing since 2021.
In interviews, several sources raised eyebrows over the fuel deal claiming some officials might have misdirected the rest of the fuel for private business.Malawi News, however, could not independently confirm the allegations.
However, according to the National Oil Company of Malawi (Nocma), only 2.3 million litres of fuel were received between September and November 2023, and the institution is unaware of what happened to the remainder.
When asked about the missing fuel, Nocma spokesperson Raymond Likambale said the donation was a government-to-government arrangement.
“It is a grant made by one President to another. Accordingly, the progress reports on the receipt of fuel are submitted to OPC [Office of the President and Cabinet]. The report showing 2.3 million litres as having been received by Nocma, was also sent to OPC for action and guidance. So, in terms of follow up, we refer you to the Office of the President and Cabinet,” Likambale said.
He further confirmed that Nocma only received 2.3 million litres of fuel between September and November 2023 and that no further consignments have arrived since then.
“We confirm receipt of 2.3 million litres. However, the original agreement was for 30 million litres, with 15 million litres allocated for each product. We only received the aforementioned 2.3 million litres, and no further shipments have been received since November 2023,” he said.
According to a Nocma memo, the DRC expressed concern over Malawi’s fuel shortages, which were attributed to a lack of foreign exchange, and decided to extend a hand of solidarity in the form of fuel supply.
“Accordingly, DRC shall dispatch fifteen million litres of diesel as well as fifteen million litres of petrol, with Malawi only responsible for logistical arrangements. This fuel supply shall be treated with utmost urgency to provide quick relief to the Malawian nation,” reads part of the memo.
The memo further said that Nocma management and a representative of the DRC government, identified as Dr. Nir, held several meetings to operationalise the fuel grant.
Malawi Newsreached Nair who said did not have full information but said deliveries may not have concluded due to logistical issues and referred the matter to Nocma for more explanation.
“I was more in the bilateral agreement, then they worked directly on the logistics, I am not sure on quantity, I know the DRC started but did not complete, due to supply problems at their port,” said Nair.
The memo also indicates that between September and November 2023, a total of 62 trucks delivered 2,336,753 litres of fuel to Malawi.
Out of this, 640,064 litres were petrol, while 1,696,689 litres were diesel. In September 2023, 41 trucks transported 1,545,286 litres of diesel.
In October, only one truck delivered 37,414 litres of diesel, while in November, 20 trucks brought in 754,053 litres comprising 640,064 litres of petrol and 113,989 litres of diesel.
WhenMalawi Newssought comment from the Office of the President and Cabinet through its spokesperson, Geoffrey Kawanga, he referred the publication to the Chief Secretary, who did not respond.
Malawi has been facing shortages of fuel supply for some time. Long queues for fuel have been persistent despite government—past and present promise to solve the situation.",0.05495495495495496,0.47875375375375373,neutral

Times,Second-hand car dealers cry foul,https://times.mw/second-hand-car-dealers-cry-foul/,politics,"By Isaac Salima
The Second-hand Car Dealers Association has expressed concern over the government’s change of tune on implementation of a new system of clearing used motor vehicles.
When presenting the mid-year budget statement to Parliament recently, Minister Finance Simplex Chithyola Banda announced that from December 01, 2023 start using Specific Taxes on used motor vehicles after gazetting customs and excise amendment orders in October this year.
It is reported that the government had, among other things, put fixed duty on cars according to size, year of make and type.
The development also meant that car importers would know in advance the amount of duty to pay for the particular motor car.
But early this month, Malawi Revenue Authority announced the revocation of the Specific Taxes and reverted to an old ad valorem tax method where the duty value is determined based on the value of a property.
The development has not gone down well with the car dealers who yesterday expressed their grievances through a press briefing in Blantyre.
The association’s president Themba Mkandawire said the change has inconvenienced them.
“These sudden changes affect us because importation of a car is not a one-day thing. It means those that had imported cars have been greatly inconvenienced because they will not have money to pay for the duty,” Mkandawire said.
In his remarks, the Second-hand Car Dealers Association General Secretary Aubrey Teputepu said they would engage the Minister of Finance to express their grievances.
“We have tried in vain to meet him and other officials. We ask for an opportunity to be heard because our capital is small and the revocation of the specific taxes will hit us hard because most of us will not be able to pay for the duty,” Teputepu said.
Chithyola Banda was not available yesterday to comment on the issue.",0.06529040404040404,0.3684217171717172,neutral
Times,Stock exchange in slow February start,https://times.mw/stock-exchange-in-slow-february-start/,politics,"The equity market opened February on a subdued note, with major indices edging lower despite pockets of buying at selected counters.
Investors took a cautious stance at the start of the new trading month.
According to theMalawi Stock Exchange(MSE) daily bulletin for February 2, the Malawi All Share Index (Masi) slipped by 633.54 points to 588,285.41, while the Domestic Share Index shed 566.20 points to close at 406,397.86.
The Foreign Share Index eased marginally by 3.42 points to 146,969.53
Market activity remained relatively firm, with total turnover reaching K89.96 billion from 158 deals, while overall market capitalisation stood at K32.07 trillion at the close of the session
Telecommunications firm TNM emerged as the day’s top gainer after its share price rose by 1.92 percentage points from K30.66 to MK31.25, pushed by strong demand that also made it the most traded counter by volume with 361,592 shares changing hands.
Blantyre Hotels posted a modest gain of 0.13 percent to K15.00, while Illovo Sugar inched up by a negligible margin to K2,680.01
However, selling pressure in heavyweight stocks weighed on the broader market.
Airtel Malawi plc saw its share price falling by 2.50 percent from K117.95 to K115.00. NBM plc share price slipped by 0.11 percent to K11,730.21, while NBS Bank plc price dropped by 0.06 percent to K891.92.
Trading data showed that more than 547,000 shares exchanged hands across the market on Monday.
The bond market remained active alongside equities, with numerous government securities quoted across different maturities.
Malawi Stock Brokers Business Development Manager Kondwani Makwakwa said there has been increasing supply on the market, driven largely by liquidity needs among investors.
According to Makwakwa, with muted demand, this has created competition on the sell side, leading to pressure on share prices.
“However, looking ahead, this phase may actually present an opportunity to long-term investors,” Makwakwa said.
Equity investor, Benedicto Nkhoma said the slowdown has also been exacerbated by the introduction of Capital Gains Tax as investors are looking at other opportunities in the market. “This is however short term and such volatility is normal. Once the results are out and investors have adjusted to inflationary pressure some arising from fuel and electricity price increases,” Nkhoma said.",0.10054788961038962,0.4486020923520924,positive
Times,MCP MPs boycott house committees,https://times.mw/mcp-mps-boycott-house-committees/,politics,"Malawi Congress Party (MCP) lawmakers Tuesday boycotted parliamentary committee meetings and vowed to maintain the protest over what they described as continued arrests of legislators.
They said they are unhappy because provisions of the Privileges Act grant legislators immunity a matter of procedure, reminding parliamentary leadership about what the Privileges Act stipulates, and it is incumbent on them to engage the other authorities.
“
For us, definitely we will be back in Parliament or here doing things related to parliamentary committees when we are 100 percent sure of our security because that’s exactly our ultimate goal,” Chithyola Banda said.
In a statement issued Tuesday, the Malawi Police Service said it had arrested Gwengwe, Kawale and former Secretary to the President and Cabinet, Colleen Zamba, in connection with investigations into contracts awarded to East Bridge involving fertiliser, soya beans and tobacco.
Malawi Police Service (MPS) spokesperson Lael Chimtembo said police officers conducted the arrests through a joint operation with the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB).
According to Chimtembo, the contracts between East Bridge and the Government of Malawi, the Ministry of Agriculture and Smallholder Farmers Fertilizer Revolving Fund of Malawi exceeded an estimated total value of K200 billion.
The suspects are being investigated for offences of abuse of office, fraud other than false pretences and money laundering.
Police say they will appear in court soon.
“The MPS wishes to assure the public that investigations are ongoing, and further details will be communicated in due course,” Chimtembo said.",-0.041666666666666664,0.46537037037037027,neutral
Times,Total withdraws South Africa court case,https://times.mw/total-withdraws-south-africa-court-case/,politics,"By Wezzie Gausi:
In what has become a multi-jurisdictional legal battle, TotalEnergies Marketing Limited has withdrawn its urgent application before the Johannesburg High Court in South Africa, clearing the way for the long-running fuel supply dispute to proceed in the High Court of Malawi.
The development is contained in correspondence from TotalEnergies’ South African lawyers, Clifford Dekker Hofmeyr Inc, dated February 2, 2026, in which the company indicates that it will, in the interim, withdraw the urgent application currently before the Johannesburg High Court.
The lawyers, however, state that their client does not agree with the earlier judgement, describing it as contrary to the law and procedurally unfair.
The lawyers, however, say all rights remain strictly reserved.
Reacting to the withdrawal, Malawi Government lawyer Lumbani Mbale, who is based in South Africa and was contracted by the Attorney General to represent Malawi in the matter, said the move effectively clears the path for the case to be heard in Malawi.
“This means that the case will now proceed in the High Court of Malawi. There is no room for arbitration because that option was already thrown out by the court,” Mbale said.
He added that the withdrawal may also signal an end to TotalEnergies’ attempts to pursue parallel proceedings in other jurisdictions.
“This may also mean that TotalEnergies will not be proceeding with the matter in the United Kingdom. They seem to be stepping back from foreign courts after failing to secure the relief they wanted,” Mbale said.
The dispute involves TotalEnergies, Prima Fuels and the Government of Malawi, and centres on unpaid funds and fuel rebates amounting to about 480 million dollars, equivalent to roughly K824 billion.
Of this amount, about 180 million United States dollars are claimed by the Malawi Government while 300 million United States dollars are owed to Prima Fuels.
The case arises from a 2002 fuel supply contract under which TotalEnergies was required to pay rebates to the Malawi Government in connection with its commercial arrangement with Prima Fuels.
TotalEnergies allegedly stopped making the payments in 2006, leading to arrears that later triggered legal action.
In 2019, the High Court approved arbitration proceedings in South Africa but the process was later terminated, forcing the matter back into Malawi courts.
In November 2025, the Malawi Supreme Court of Appeal dismissed TotalEnergies’ attempt to block the claim and directed that the dispute return to the High Court Commercial Division for a full trial.
Justice Rowland Mbvundula, delivering the ruling on behalf of a nine-member panel, ordered that the trial begin within 45 days and directed TotalEnergies to pay the costs of the appeal.
Despite the Supreme Court’s ruling, TotalEnergies has since pursued fresh arbitration proceedings in London while also filing applications in South Africa.
Attorney General Frank Mbeta and Prima Fuels had planned to ask the High Court Commercial Division in Lilongwe to issue an injunction against the London arbitration, arguing that TotalEnergies’ actions amounted to forum shopping and a direct challenge to Malawi’s judicial authority.
However, with the withdrawal of the South African case, attention now shifts back to the High Court of Malawi, where the substantive trial is expected to proceed in line with the Supreme Court’s directive.
Recently, Mbeta lamented the multi-jurisdictional nature of the case.",0.058440766550522646,0.3280574912891986,neutral
Times,Local coaches to understudy expert,https://times.mw/local-coaches-to-understudy-expert/,sports,"Following the Malawi National Netball Team’s awful display at the Africa Netball Cup in 2025, Netball Association of Malawi (Nam) has taken a strategic move to hire an international netball consultant to revive the senior side.
The Queens finished fourth at the continental tournament, missing automatic qualification for the 2027 Netball World Cup finals in Sydney, Australia.
In a statement released yesterday, Nam indicated that it had embarked on a comprehensive high‑performance reset for the Queens as part of preparations for the 2026 Commonwealth Games and the 2026 Africa Netball Cup, Netball World Cup Qualifiers.
“This strategic initiative reflects Nam’s commitment to enhancing tactical performance, strengthening technical capacity and building long‑term sustainability while preserving and enhancing Malawi’s rich and respected netball culture.
“At the centre of this reset is the engagement of [an] international high‑performance expert to work alongside Malawi Netball’s technical leadership, athletes and support staff. The focus is on modernising training systems, strengthening match execution, improving conditioning and mental resilience and ensuring the Malawi Queens are fully prepared to compete consistently against the world’s best,” the statement, which has been signed by Nam General Secretary Yamikani Khungwa-Kauma, reads.
The Nam GS says the expatriate would also focus on capacity building and succession planning of six Malawian coaches that would be identified and embedded into the high‑performance environment.
“This structured mentorship and hands‑on training model is designed to accelerate technical and tactical knowledge transfer, improve coaching standards across the national pathway, build a sustainable pool of elite local coaches and ensure long‑term continuity beyond the current competition cycle. This approach ensures that the benefits of international expertise extend well beyond the national team, strengthening the broader Malawian netball ecosystem,” Khungwa-Kauma said.
Currently, the Queens and junior national teams are without coaches following the expiry of contracts for respective mentors.
However, Khungwa-Kauma said qualified coaches were free to apply for the jobs which have been advertised.
Meanwhile, the association’s president Vitumbiko Mwandemange -Gubuduza has said the initiative comes at a pivotal moment for Malawi Netball.
“The Malawi Queens have a proud and respected history on the international stage, inspiring players and supporters across the country. Following encouraging performances at the Netball Youth World Cup and the Africa Netball Cup, the focus is now firmly on converting emerging talent into consistent senior‑level success with the support of Nico Group and our oversight Ministry.
Local netball pundit Neffie Kam’mata lauded the move.
“We need fresh and different ideas to revamp our netball. Otherwise, our netball will continue regressing,” she said.
In a related development, three Malawi Queens players — Tendai Masamba, Melia Soko and Stella Matelezi—will feature in the Singapore’s Deloitte Netball Super League next month.
This follows an initiative by United Kingdom-based athletes management firm Step Out 7 and Netball Singapore.
Khungwa-Kauma said the month-long stay in Singapore would give the trio invaluable additional exposure, competitive experience against top talent and further development in a professional environment.
According to a statement from Nam, Vanessa Sisters’ centre Soko and Blue Eagles Sisters’ attacker Matelezi were spotted at the Netball World Youth Cup in Gibraltar and the Africa Netball Cup 2025.
Tigresses’ all-rounder Tendai Masamba has been one of the consistent performers for the Queens.
Meanwhile, Step Out 7 and Netball Singapore have expressed excitement with the players, who include those from other African countries such as Uganda and Zimbabwe.",0.09280303030303029,0.31117424242424235,neutral
Times,Court orders Tamia Ja’s arrest,https://times.mw/court-orders-tamia-jas-arrest/,other,"By Jimmy Chazama
The Lilongwe Senior Resident Magistrate Court on Tuesday issued a warrant of arrest for renowned content creator Hannah Jabes, popularly known as Tamia Ja, following her repetitive failure to appear in court for proceedings related to a case of alleged unlawful disclosure of health information.
Tamia Ja was expected to appear before the court yesterday to take plea in a case brought forward by the State, which accuses her of publicly revealing the health status of another individual without consent. It marked her second consecutive absence, having also failed to attend a scheduled hearing on August 26, 2025.
On the previous occasion, the court opted for leniency, ordering her to pay a fine of K50,000 within seven days instead of issuing an arrest warrant.
However, the fine was never paid and she, again, failed to honour Tuesday’s summons. Public prosecutor Bruno Matumbi, who is leading the prosecution team, expressed concern over the delays caused by the accused’s noncompliance.
“What transpired is that the matter was called for hearing, specifically for the accused to take plea and allow the prosecution to commence [proceedings]. But she did not show up. This is the second time,” Matumbi said. He said the court had previously issued a fine instead of a warrant, but that she neither paid the fine nor appeared at the court on Tuesday despite receiving a summons.
“She has disobeyed the court twice. The witnesses had been brought to court on both occasions, only to be sent back due to the accused’s absence,” Matumbi said.
He said the court has since ordered that Tamia Ja be arrested and held in police custody until the trial concludes to ensure her presence in future proceedings.
“The aim of the warrant is to secure her attendance. When she is on bail, she is taking advantage of her freedom to miss court dates. This measure ensures the trial proceeds without further waste of public resources,” Matumbi said.",0.006565656565656569,0.27828282828282824,neutral

South African artistsYoung Stunnaand Nkosazana Daughter performed in the country once again over the weekend sharing the stage with local acts Fadah Moti and Saint Realest at Illusionz Bar, Restaurant and Club in Lilongwe.
The two artists from the rainbow nation have had stints in the country but they got another opportunity at Illusionz during a four-day music festival which also marked the reopening of the entertainment outfit following a month-long renovation.
The event, which started on Friday and ended on Sunday, attracted a huge crowd. Young Stunna, known for the ‘Adiwele’, took to the stage clad in his signature gloves and glasses. Backed by a DJ, the Amapiano star performed for close to an hour, thrilling fans with songs such as ‘Ilanga’ and ‘Bayeke.’
Before Young Stunna’s set, Fadah Moti and his dancers entertained the audience dishing out songs like ‘Kuwala’, ‘Mudyera’, and ‘Msandithawe’, which had people singing along. On Sunday, Nkosazana Daughter joined the party. The ‘Dali Wami’ creator did not disappoint as with her dancers kept the audience on the dance floor throughout her performance. Her dance moves were a marvel to watch.
Earlier on, Saint warmed up the stage with his live band and served tracks such as ‘Neria’ and ‘Mtenga Moyo’, which resonated well with the audience.
On Saturday night, the fiesta featured a free-entry takeover show with music offered by DJs VJ Ice and Skippy. Amapiano mayor Zeze Kingston was also not left out of the bill as he performed on the last day to close the four-day celebration on a high. Illusionz Marketing Executive DJ Nathan Tunes said that the colourful reopening was the beginning of more things to come for fun lovers.
“The place now has a fresh face that matches what our audience wants. Watch the space for more performances of artists both local and international,” he said.

The Supreme Court of Appeal has ruled against the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM)’s decision to revoke the licence for proprietors of Finance Bank.
A seven-member panel of justices, led by Chief Justice Rizine Mzikamanda, heard a case where Finance Bank’s legal team challenged RBM’s decision to revoke the licence in 2005.
The court has also ordered RBM to compensate Finance Bank for loss of business and profits from 2005.
In its ruling, made yesterday, the court found out that the central bank’s decision was excessive, “as there were other regulatory measures that could have been used”.
Finance Bank was represented by Wapona Kita and Mordecai Msisha.
“All the judges unanimously agreed with us that RBM acted illegally by revoking the licence. Since we also applied for compensation, the court has also awarded us [compensation] and we have referred the matter back to our financial expert to do the calculations and we will get back to the court with figures,” Kita said.
RBM was represented in the matter by James Masumbu, who was not available for a comment on the ruling.
RBM closed Finance bank in 2005 for allegedly contravening banking laws.
The bank was accused of dealing in irregular foreign exchange transactions, with RBM also alleging that some bank accounts had not met proper requirements under the Know Your Customer requirement.
RBM cited violations which dated back to 1999.
Finance Bank took the matter to court in 2006, when one of its shareholders, Rajan Mahtani, challenged the revocation but lost the case in the Commercial Court Division",-0.08,0.21000000000000002,neutral
Times,Floods response gets $22.3 million boost,https://times.mw/floods-response-gets-22-3-million-boost/,politics,"Malawi has received about $2.3 million (about K3.9 billion) from a $22.3 million package that The Regional Emergency Preparedness and Access to Inclusive Recovery (Repair) Programme has disbursed to Mozambique and Malawi.
The financial support is for urgent national flood response operations in the two countries.
In a statement, Repair, a World Bank programme, says it is providing rapid, pre-arranged financing to enable governments to mobilise life-saving assistance immediately after a shock.
The funds will be used for purchasing life-saving supplies, including food and medical kits, water storage and sanitation equipment and emergency shelter and household items.
“The programme released the funds within seven business days of both activation requests. Speed is absolutely critical following a natural disaster, which is why Repair is committed to disbursing funds rapidly and effectively to its participating countries following shocks,” the statement reads.
Eastern and Southern Africa remains one of the world’s most climate-vulnerable regions in the world.
Repair is being implemented by African Risk Capacity (ARC) Ltd with financial support from the Global Shield Financing Facility (GSFF).
ARC Chief Executive Officer David Maslo said in times of crisis, rapid support could make a difference between a shock and a humanitarian emergency.
“Through Repair, ARC Ltd is supporting Malawi and Madagascar in these difficult circumstances by ensuring that critical funding reaches the government quickly, as demonstrated by this disbursement delivered within seven business days of the activation request, so that relief can be mobilised before conditions deteriorate,” he said.
Figures indicate that floods in Nkhotakota District and surrounding areas in late December 2025 directly affected over 49,000 people (approximately 10,900 households), claiming 12 victims and displacing 2,132 families who had to be relocated to temporary camps hosted in schools, churches and a health centre.
The country’s response to the floods is being coordinated by the Department of Disaster Management Affairs (Dodma).
Dodma spokesperson Chipiliro Khamula said the funds are made available when there is extensive damage such that countries may not cope-up with.
“The goal is to provide life-saving interventions without necessarily waiting for a post-disaster needs assessment which may take longer,” he said.
In Mozambique, flooding in the provinces of Maputo, Gaza and Sofala has partially, or totally, destroyed over 15,000 homes, directly impacting over 231,000 people. The death toll has already reached 112.
These are the programme’s third and fourth disbursements since its creation in July 2024.
Repair had previously supported relief and recovery efforts in Comoros and Mozambique following the passage of cyclones Chido and Jude, respectively.",0.033888888888888885,0.3533333333333333,neutral

He said they also wanted to raise awareness on issues related to the upcoming 6th edition of the Blantyre 42.195km race, which is scheduled for September 7 2024.
“These health walks, which will be starting from 2pm, are free-of-charge and open to everyone. So, we encourage everyone to participate [in them]. Beyond regulating sports in the country, we also have a duty to promote widespread participation [of people] in sports and physical activities. These walks are part of that effort.
“They also serve to familiarise Blantyre citizens and the nation with the marathon route,” Ntulumbwa said.
He said the walks were designed to promote the Blantyre 42.195km race with the goal of continuing to organise them after the competition.
“The walks will trace the marathon route, beginning at the main gate of Kamuzu Stadium and passing through key landmarks including the ShopRite roundabout, Independence Arc, Kenyatta Drive and Kwacha Round-about, before looping through Kamba, Kapeni, Kuhes [Kamuzu University of Health Sciences] and several other notable locations, and finally returning to the stadium,” Ntulumbwa said.
He said similar health walks are planned for Lilongwe, starting from Kamuzu Institute for Sports, and also in Mzuzu.

Times,"Focus on irrigation, government urged",https://times.mw/focus-on-irrigation-government-urged/,politics,"Stakeholders in the agriculture sector have reiterated the need for the government to focus on enhancing irrigation farming to counter possible shocks perpetuated by the impending El Nino weather.
A recent global information and early warning system on food and agriculture update published by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (Fao) indicates that Malawi is among Southern African countries that will experience extreme heat weather conditions between November and March 2024.
In an interview, Civil Society Agriculture Network Chairperson Helbert Chagona said there is a need to assess and enhance existing irrigation infrastructure to increase water availability during dry periods.
“Investments in irrigation systems, including small-scale and community-based irrigation schemes, can ensure water access for crops during extreme weather conditions.
“We need to promote water harvesting techniques such as construction of small dams, ponds and water storage systems,” Chigona said.
He said efficient water management and conservation strategies can help farmers store water during the wet season and use it judiciously during dry periods.
He said the country must strengthen meteorological services to provide accurate and timely weather information to farmers. Improved forecasting can help them make informed decisions regarding planting schedules, irrigation and crop management.
Speaking on the sidelines of the Insurance Institute of Malawi annual conference, Minister of Finance Sosten Gwengwe said crop insurance could help avert the impact of extreme weather including the looming El Nino.
“We are running an economy with no buffers. Ours is not a resilient economy because any calamity that comes hits the people directly.
“We have been hit by a number of shocks recently and to hear of an impending El Nino, our prayer is that it should not materialise but if it does, crop insurance now comes on the table and you could see that, going forward, resilience is the main thing and insurance is at the centre of it,” Gwengwe said.
According to the World Food Programme, during the 2020-2021 farming season, nearly 65,000 farming households in Malawi received cash pay-outs from an agricultural insurance programme amounting to $2.4 million after drought and pests destroyed crops.",0.0004385964912280774,0.47719298245614045,neutral
Times,Piggery: Andrew Msope’s lucrative side hustle,https://times.mw/piggery-andrew-msopes-lucrative-side-hustle/,sports,"By Elia Chibwe:
Andrew Msope, 35, from Chimbalanga Village, Traditional Authority (TA) Kadewere in Chiradzulu, decided to invest the capital he earned from his salary into livestock farming, including raising rabbits, ducks and pigs, after facing numerous challenges over several years.
Married with two children, Msope struggled to meet his family’s basic needs despite his employment as an Accountant at the Agricultural Research and Extension Trust.
He realised that his salary was insufficient to meet his family’s needs and pay for his children’s school fees.
“Starting pig farming was a means of increasing income. When I realised that my salary alone was inadequate to cover school fees and other needs, pig farming became a side hustle to boost my income,” he explains.
As Msope invested more capital in piggery, he observed that the venture was a game changer and highly profitable, as each pig could produce more than 10 piglets.
Since starting his pig farming business in 2019, he has achieved considerable success. He has managed to purchase three cars, a motorbike and has built shops in various locations within Lilongwe.
He has also constructed a house and established a large farm known as Msope Farmstead.
Through pig farming, Msope has employed 10 permanent workers and hires other casual workers to work on his fields where he grows maize, cabbage and soya beans within Lilongwe district.
The accountant-turned-farmer reveals that farming has also enabled him to build strong relationships with buyers and identify good markets.
“We sell piglets to upcoming farmers and organisations and also engage in value addition. We supply pork to hotels and Chinese and Nigerian restaurants,” Msope says.
Despite the strides taken in piggery, Msope aims to raise 1,000 pigs at various stages and expand his capacity to meet customer demand.
Msope Farmstead Marketing Officer Jimmy Simfukwe praises the job opportunity, which he says has improved the livelihoods of his family.
Simfukwe recalls struggling to find employment since completing his studies at Mzuzu University in 2022.
The job opportunity has not only addressed Simfukwe’s economic needs but has also equipped him with valuable skills.
“I have learned marketing skills and how to design good pig kraals for improved yield. I have also learned veterinary services from veterinary officers who attend to the pigs’ medical needs,” he says.
Msope’s venture aligns with the government’s efforts to promote animal husbandry in the country through various interventions.
Director of Animal Health and Livestock Development, Julius Chiwanga Chulu, stated in a response to a questionnaire that, besides conducting regular farmer training sessions, the government has established livestock multiplication centres to enhance livestock husbandry, including pig farming.
“Government-run livestock multiplication centres offer breeding stock, including pigs, at affordable prices. These centres also serve as demonstration sites where farmers can learn best practices in animal husbandry,” Chulu said.
He also revealed that the government is reviewing legislation to address emerging and re-emerging issues.
According to the director, the government has implemented numerous investment programmes to support livestock development, including piggery.
“The Agriculture Commercialisation Project (Agcom 1) provided matching grants to producer organisations to venture into various enterprises, including piggery,” he said.
Chulu recommended pig farming as a highly profitable venture and encouraged people to engage in the business or apply for loans from the National Economic Empowerment Fund if they are unable to start on their own.
Agriculture policy expert Tamani Nkhono Mvula commended the government for its livestock policies but urged it to provide more support to pig farmers.
“What we may need is initial capital investment to start the programme. Once started, it is a highly profitable business capable of sustaining itself in the long run.
“There needs to be greater effort from policymakers to support pig production, including providing information on the enterprise,” he said.
According to the National Livestock Development Policy for 2021-2026, Malawi aims to increase the livestock sector’s contribution to overall agricultural production by 50 percent by 2026 through effective interventions in animal production, health and value chains.
The policy also targets a 10 percent increase in the value of livestock exports and a 60 percent increase in the adoption of new livestock technologies.
It further notes that meeting the growing demand for livestock and livestock products in both domestic and export markets requires strategies that promote growth in numbers and productivity.—Mana",0.1394344061735366,0.4066313034791296,positive
Times,‘Malawi is at a crossroads’,https://times.mw/malawi-is-at-a-crossroads/,politics,"By Cathy Maulidi
Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace (CCJP) has branded Malawi’s current socio-economic status as one that is reminiscent of a country whose leadership has stopped listening.
In a statement signed by the commission’s national coordinator Boniface Chibwana and other officials, CCJP says the socio-economic wellbeing of Malawians has significantly deteriorated, with the governing apparatus seemingly lost and clueless on solutions.
But government spokesperson Moses Kunkuyu insisted that problems the country is sailing through are not of the current administration’s making.
In its statement, CCJP says Malawi is at a crossroads and that citizens are like sheep whose shepherd has lost grip of the flock.
“The cries of Malawians are now louder, but unfortunately, fail to attract the much-needed attention of political leaders as they fall on deaf ears.
“CCJP is deeply concerned about the prevailing social injustice and prays that Malawi’s political stewards regain their moral enlightenment and become sensitive to the [suffering of] Malawians,” the commission says.
The Catholic Church’s justice and peace body has cited problems such as the current fuel crisis, devaluation of the Kwacha and security lapse as some of the problems that Malawians are enduring.
CCJP has further warned about looming hunger due to uncertainties regarding the procurement, distribution and availability of fertiliser.
In an interview Wednesday, Kunkuyu said the statement echoes what the Tonse Alliance government has been saying; that the country has been plunged into problems for ages due to corruption, among other vices.
“Cyclones have worsened our situation, making us perpetually donor dependent. Government is working towards resolving these challenges, mainly the issue of forex scarcity.
“Once this is addressed, it will open up solutions to the other problems,” Kunkuyu said.
He added that the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) staff-level agreement brings a glimmer of hope that Malawi’s foreign reserves will be healthy again.
“This will enable us to procure fuel and drive the economic sectors that thrive on the availability of fuel,” Kunkuyu said.
The minister further said it is government’s hope that the mega farms will address the food security situation and deal with hunger perpetually.
“The statement is appreciated, and Malawians are assured that the problems are being addressed,” the government spokesperson said.",0.007499999999999997,0.3475,neutral
Times,Court hears MCP primaries dispute,https://times.mw/court-hears-mcp-primaries-dispute/,politics,"Two witnesses in the Mzimba Central Constituency primary elections dispute Tuesday disowned the electoral college presented to them by the Malawi Congress Party (MCP) North South Region Chairperson, citing errors in the document.
The matter, currently before the High Court in Mzuzu, involves Trade Minister Vitumbiko Mumba as the claimant, with MCP as the first defendant and Presidential Advisor Adamson Kuseri Mkandawire as the second defendant.
In the disputed primaries, MCP declared Mkandawire the winner in an election presided over by the party’s Maxwell Thyolera.
The claimant presented three witnesses, Mumba himself, Mzimba Central Constituency Chairperson Whyton Shaba and Euthini District Secretary Mathews Shaba.
During cross-examination, Mathews Shaba said they had been told to sign the document containing the electoral college in haste, as the regional chairperson was rushing to a meeting in Mpherembe.
He said the regional chairperson had advised them to review and verify the document within three days, after they had already signed it.
“I later got a call from the constituency secretary saying the list we signed had errors. We attempted to meet the regional chairperson to raise our concerns but did not find him at the office.
“We later spoke over the phone and he told me it was out of his hands, meaning it had been referred to the National Executive Committee (Nec),” Mathews Shaba said.
He added that they followed up with Nec, which promised to send a delegation to verify the electoral college.
“They indeed came but only covered three areas, promising to return but have not done so to date,” he said.
Whyton Shaba also testified that the elections were not conducted in a free and fair manner and therefore could not be recognised.
He said they were instructed to use a 2018 electoral college, which had 37 areas, but due to a demarcation exercise, 13 new areas had been created which required verification. This process, he said, was only partially completed.
Similarly, speaking before the two witnesses, Mumba stated that there was still no agreement on the electoral college and that the primary elections never took place.
Furthermore, Mumba said he was never informed that primary elections would be held.
Regarding the electoral college, Mumba described it as bogus, insisting that some names in the new areas appeared twice while others from the original list were missing.
Pressing on, lawyer Justin Dzonzi, representing Mkandawire, asked the claimant to produce the names that were erroneously included in the electoral college and those that were omitted.
During the hearing, the defence played two videos in which commentary alleged that the claimant had hired thugs to disrupt the disputed primary elections, which were conducted on May 11, 2025.
“I am wondering, none of the witnesses has commented on this violence, not even you in the exhibits. Why is that?” Dzonzi asked.
However, Mumba said the issue had been reported to Kafukule Police Station, arrests had been made, and that they had not included the matter in the exhibits because it is now a criminal case.
Meanwhile, the case, presided over by Justice Justus Kishindo, will resume today for cross-examination of three defence witnesses including Mkandawire, after which the court will give direction.",0.0938047138047138,0.4447194163860831,neutral
Times,Business subdued in 2023—MCCCI,https://times.mw/business-subdued-in-2023-mccci/,economy,"By Wezzie Gausi:
The 2023 Malawi Business Climate Survey published by the Malawi Confederations of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (MCCCI), indicates that 50 percent of businesses increased their levels of production, while 20.4 percent decreased their levels of production in the gone by.
According to the report, the poor performance is attributed to shortage of foreign currency with which to import raw materials, high levels of inflation and fuel scarcity which affected business operations especially in the transportation and construction sectors.
The report further shows that subdued demand for goods and services by consumers, and high cost of loanable funds for investment also had an impact on business performance, among others.
However, the report shows that the performance of businesses in 2023 was better than the previous year, according to the results of the survey.
“In the year under review, 27 percent of businesses rated their performance as good and 35 percent as fair while in 2022, 18 percent of businesses rated their performance as good and 25 percent as fair.
“Businesses expect better performance in 2024 than in 2023 due to the stability of electricity supply, availability of foreign currency, and the confidence that an inflow of FDI will follow as a result of the Extended Credit Facility and budgetary support from the World Bank,” the report reads.
The report further highlighted that in the year 2023, 16.1 percent of the businesses decreased their capital expenditure, compared to 13.2 percent in 2022. In 2024, only 5.8 percent of businesses are expected to decrease their capital expenditure.
Furthermore, there was marginal improvement in capital expenditure with 64.2 percent of the businesses increasing their capital expenditure in 2023, compared to 56.1 percent in 2022. In 2024, 78.1 percent of businesses plan to increase their capital expenditure.
In an interview Secretary to Treasury Betchani Tchereni said it’s good to know that business generally performed better than the previous year although in a difficult environment.
He said some of the challenges faced are exogenous and must be dealt with.
“For example, it is always the expectation of the government that foreign exchange generation is an expertise of the sector. Although many may not have operated due to the scarcity of forex, that should have been an opportunity for the private sector, especially those in manufacturing, to venture into import knowing that there are so many products which Malawians need but are not produced in the country,” Tchereni said.
Ministry of Trade Spokesperson Mayeso Msokera said indeed,most businesses failed to perform in the year 2023due to the highlighted challenges.
“ However, going forward the economic outlook is more promising for the coming years due to expected improvement in the availability of foreign exchange following the acquisition of the IMF Extended Credit Facility (ECF) program; establishment of several mega farms and operationalization of the AfCFTA agreement in Malawi, resumptions of consistent power supply; better fuel availability just to mention but a few positive developments, ” Msokera said.",0.09351489251489252,0.4726739186739187,neutral
